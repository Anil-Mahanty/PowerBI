Dataset design and settings
Dataset design, and their settings, can impact on gateway workloads. To reduce gateway workload, you can consider the following actions.
For Import datasets:
	• Configure less frequent data refresh
	• Configure incremental refresh to minimize the amount of data to transfer
	• Whenever possible, ensure query folding takes place
	• Especially for large data volumes or a need for low-latency results, convert the design to a DirectQuery or Composite model
For DirectQuery datasets:
	• Optimize data sources, model, and report designs—for more information, see DirectQuery model guidance in Power BI Desktop
	• Create aggregations to cache higher-level results to reduce the number of DirectQuery requests
	• Restrict Automatic page refresh intervals, in report designs and capacity settings
	• Especially when dynamic RLS is enforced, restrict dashboard cache update frequency
	• Especially for smaller data volumes or for non-volatile data, convert the design to an Import or Composite model
For Live Connection datasets:
	• Especially when dynamic RLS is enforced, restrict dashboard cache update frequency

Data Model:
-----------------------
Here are the steps involved in data modelling: 
	1. Review the business challenge/BRD/FRD
	2. Pull the right data from the business need
	3. Collect and organize data
	4. Create a conceptual model
	5. Build the logical design
	6. Build the physical design
	7. Map stakeholders and their requirements of the data model
	8. Perform a gap analysis of requirements vs. datasets
	9. Create report/dashboard  results
	10. Measure & modify data model to meet changing requirements
