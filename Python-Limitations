Limitations
Python visuals in Power BI Desktop have the following limitations:

	1. The data the Python visual uses for plotting is limited to 150,000 rows. If more than 150,000 rows are selected, only the top 150,000 rows are used, and a message appears on the image. The input data also has a limit of 250 MB.
	2. If a Python visual calculation exceeds five minutes, the execution times out, which results in an error. 60secs in services
	3. Memory consumption & Disk I/O: Limit 1GB
	4. Image size for a visual in PNG format	2 MB
	5. Python visuals respond to highlighting elements in other visuals, but you can't select elements in the Python visual to cross-filter other elements.
	6. Python visuals don't support renaming input columns. Columns are referred to by their original names during script execution.
	7. Python support in Power BI personal gateway
	8. Python script execution is not supported for on-premises data gateways shared by multiple users
	9. The following Python packages (non-Intel MKL) are currently supported for use in your Power BI reports:
	matplotlib --> creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
	numpy --> working with numerical data / arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices, multi-dimensional arrays
	pandas --> mainly works with the tabular data, for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. using DataFrame and Series tools
	scikit-learn --> ibrary that implements a range of machine learning, pre-processing, cross-validation
	scipy --> used for scientific computing and technical computing, can say built on the NumPy extension
	seaborn --> visualization library based on matplotlib. Seaborn is more comfortable in handling Pandas data frames.provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has easily interesting default themes
	statsmodels --> allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests
